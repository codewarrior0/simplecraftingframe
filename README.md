# Simple Crafting Frame

Adds a Crafting Frame block. After storing a crafting recipe in the Frame,
right-click on it to craft using items in your inventory. If the Frame is placed
next to a container such as a Chest, it will also craft using its items.

Inspired by the Super Crafting Frame mod - built from scratch for the Fabric 
Mod Loader without any knowledge of the original mod's workings.

Created for Minecraft 1.14 (Snapshot 18w50a) and Fabric.
